Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news by analyzing text data. It uses NLP to preprocess text and machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest for classification. Statistical analysis and data visualization are also incorporated to evaluate and display model performance.

Features
Data Manipulation: Data preprocessing and cleaning using Pandas.
Text Processing: Tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and n-gram generation using NLTK.
Machine Learning Models: Includes Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing using Chi-square and other statistical methods.
Visualization: Model performance and data insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
